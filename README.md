# health-data-api

* The purpose of the project is to use machine learning to predict health issues in pregnant women using data from smartwatch like devices as data collectors. 
* The api will be the connection point between collection and the processing parts of the system.
* As it currently stands, I'm working to understand the data that will be needed for these machine learning models. Each piece of information will be added to the api as it becomes needed.
